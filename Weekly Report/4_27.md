## Summary

1. scripts in repo are all in Python
2. brownvisualprosthesis/face_recognition/data includes generated npy (NumPy files) and html,  should be used for testing
3. not checked: 
    1. brownvisualprosthesis/face_recognition/legacy 
    2. brownvisualprosthesis/face_recognition/depricated
4. public modules are shown in brownvisualprosthesis/face_recognition/requirements.txt
5. Dependency diagram for files in the brownvisualprosthesis/face_recognition directory

## Problems:

1. unit-testing is hard (or could be skipped?): sklearn(scikit-learn) too old, current version 0.0, which was released in 2015 â†’ seems not compatible with Mac with m1 chip, needs ssh for remote control
2. too much generated npys and htmls, which are considered to be generated in testing

## Questions:

1. Is zmq used as both a client and a server, as in one module in vp, namely face recognition here?
2. More reference for integration with vp modules are desired
